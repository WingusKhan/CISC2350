# Responsive Web Development
Creating a *responsive* website or web page means you are developing your HTML and CSS to work across multiple screen sizes.  Nowadays, [anything and everything](http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/) with a screen can have a web browser.  This means that as web developers, it is our responsibility to ensure that we create websites that work at any (or most) screen size(s).  Your site should be readable and accessible on multiple devices of varying sizes, including but not limited to:  smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

## Metadata: `viewport`

```html
<!--
	- Tells the browser to match the device's width for the viewport
	- Sets an initial pixel scale
-->
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

## Using `@media` queries

## Common device widths

## Mobile First

## Use fluid and relative units
