# Assignment 2 Prompt
The assignment for this week will be in two parts:  using CSS to style your bio page submitted last week, and submitting your updated bio page to GitHub using Git.

##Git Setup
By this point, [you should already have Git installed on your computer](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  During our last lecture, we walked through how to set up your local class repository, your corresponding GitHub repository, and linking the class and origin remotes to your local repository.  If you have not done this or need a refresher, return to the [main class repository page](https://github.com/yurm04/CISC2350) and go through the instructions to get set up.

## Styled Bio Page
Using the bio page HTML file you completed for assignment 1 and the CSS skills we picked up during our lecture, create a separate `style.css` stylesheet to breath some life into your bio page.  Get creative and use the properties that we discussed in class, as well as properties you discover on your own.

## Assignment Submission
First, read up on [how to structure your assignment submission directory](https://github.com/yurm04/CISC2350/wiki/Class-Assignments).  When you have successfully set up your submission directory with all of your necessary files, push your changes up to your GitHub repo.  After your changes have been pushed up to GitHub, navigate to your assignment `submission` folder, copy the link to the page, and submit the link to the BlackBoard assignment.  This will make sure that you submit an assignment to BlackBoard for my records, and that I will have a way to find your `submission` directory on GitHub with the link you submit.

## Grading Breakdown
- 50pts for the bio page style sheet
- 10pts for a valid CSS file using the [W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri)
- 30pts to push your assignment submission to **your GitHub repo** and submit the GitHub link (linking to your submission folder) via the BlackBoard assignment.
- 10pts to [add me as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) to your **private** repo.
