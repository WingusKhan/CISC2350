# Contributing to the CISC 2350 Repo
Everyone is welcome to contribute this class repo, but we want to make sure we remain consistent and efficient with our contributions.  Below you will find the basic guidelines and requirements for submitting pull requests, reviewing another student's pull request, creating issues, and just generally how not to be a jerk on the internet.

## Issues
Check out the [repo issues](https://github.com/yurm04/CISC2350/issues) if you need a place to start.  This is where I will be posting errors, typos, prompts, or suggestions that are up for the taking.  You can pick an issue you'd like to work on, make your changes to address/fix the issue, and then create a pull request. *PLEASE NOTE* before working on an issue, please ensure that the issue has the "help wanted" label associated with it in order to be certain that the issue should be worked on.  If you open a pull request that pertains to an open issue make sure you:

1. Mention and link to the issue in the pull request e.x. "This PR addresses Issue #17".  GitHub will automatically see that you have mentioned the issue in your PR and associate one with the other.
2. Once your issue PR is open, leave a comment on the issue ticket to inform the group that you have a PR awaiting to be merged e.x. "I have submitted pull request #6 to fix this issue."  Again, GitHub will see that you mentioned the PR in the issue and automatically associate one with the other.

### Issue Labels
Issues are labeled with specific tags to better sort and identify them.  The labels we will be using for issues are as follows:

- Bug - a bug in the sample code that needs to be fixed.
- Typo - some typo in the notes or guides that can be corrected.
- Enhancement - A feature that can be added either to the notes, sample code, or entire repository.
- Prompt - An opportunity to research, explore, explain, or experiment with some programming topic.
- help wanted - the issue has been approved to be worked on (by the instructor :smile:).
- Difficulty - the estimated amount of effort necessary to complete the issue
	- easy: quick, simple
	- medium: Slightly more involved and may require more time, but relatively simple to accomplish.
	- hard: Challenging or very time consuming (within reason).

### Creating an Issue
Anyone can make an issue for a bug, enhancement, typo, or prompt.  When creating an issue, please make sure to do the following:

- Create a descriptive but concise title.
- Add as much detail as possible to the issue description: e.x. What is the issue, how can it be replicated, which files should be focused on, screenshots, etc.
- Add the appropriate labels to the issue.  **PLEASE NOTE** I will be approving student generated issues so that we know what is available to work on.  Do not approve your own issues unless given permission.
